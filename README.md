# Advent of Code 2023

I'm back for AoC 2023, this time in TypeScript!

The later days are more difficult (especially day 20+ for me), and credit is given where due.

## Input
All input is read from TXT files under the `inputs/` folder that you need to make prior to executing any code.

## Environment Details

My npx version:
```bash
$ npx --version
9.3.0
```

To execute a specific TypeScript file on Node, I personally do:
```
$ alias ts="npx ts-node"
$ ts dayX.ts
```
